        <h2>Ultimate guide to martingale collars</h2>
        <p>
          No matter what lifestyle you and your dog enjoy, a safe and secure way
          to take them for a walk is a necessity. With a skittish pup or a tough
          puller, walks can quickly become a stressful activity for you and your
          dog. Experienced trainers and rescues recommend our martingale collars
          because they are the perfect tool to help take back control of your
          walks. These collars are reliably safe and comfortable for dogs of all
          shapes and sizes. If you are instead looking for a flat collar, you
          can find our selection here.

                <p>
                  Martingale collars are composed of two sections: a fixed
                  portion (neck loop) and a control loop. The leash is attached
                  to a D-ring on the control loop, which adjusts. This loop can
                  only tighten to the length of the fixed portion -- allowing
                  enough tightening to keep your dog from slipping out no matter
                  how hard they pull, but ensuring the collar will not be able
                  to tighten so far as to injure your dog. Rescue organizations,
                  such as Lucky Dog Rescue, use and recommend martingale collars
                  “because shelter dogs can be more skittish at times,
                  [Martingale] collars are the safest way to prevent escapes".
                </p>
                <h2>Escape-proof Functionality</h2>
                <p>
                  Martingale collars are commonly used for dogs who need to be
                  reminded of their manners when walking on a leash. The
                  tightening of the control loop does not hurt the dog but does
                  cause discomfort that encourages them to stop pulling while on
                  leash. It is important that your dog does not lean into the
                  collar and consistently pull. Martingales are designed to
                  tighten when necessary and remain relaxed the majority of the
                  time. When your dog pulls, gently pull back. Stop walking if
                  necessary. As soon as your dog releases the pressure applied
                  to the collar, continue walking. Your dog will quickly learn
                  not to put pressure on the collar. If you find your dog pulls
                  constantly, we recommend seeking the assistance of a trained
                  professional to help you with some basic loose leash walking
                  skills and training.

                  waterproof, and are included in the base price for all of our
                  collars. They are strength rated for even the toughest of

                  Metal & Plastic (hybrid) - Hybrid buckles combine plastic and
                  aluminum to offer a light weight, good looking, and strong
                  option. The aluminum side of these buckles are engraved for
                  increased longevity.

                <h2>Measuring for a martingale collar</h2>
                <p>
                  Step 1 - Measure Dog's Neck: Using a (soft) sewing tape,
                  measure around your dog’s neck where their collar normally
                  sits. Pull the tape until it is snug but not tight. You should
                  be able to comfortably put two fingers between the measuring
                  tape and your dog's neck. Record this measurement, it will be
                  the primary factor to consider when selecting a size.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i
                    >If you do not have a soft tape, use a piece of string (or
                    similar) and measure around your dog’s neck using the above
                    instructions. Lay the string flat and use a ruler or tape
                    measure to obtain the measurement.</i
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  Step 2 - Measure Dog's Head: If you are ordering a standard
                  martingale (without a buckle), the collar will need to
                  comfortably fit the dog's neck, but also adjust to be large
                  enough to fit over their head and ears. Using the same method
                  from Step 1, measure the head starting at the throat and going
                  over the ears. Record the measurements and use while
                  determining the correct size collar to order.

                <h2>Custom Sizing is Important for Martingale Collars</h2>
                <p>
                  It is recommended that Martingale Collars be ordered as close
                  to the true size of your dog's neck as possible. This will
                  ensure not only the best possible fit but also the accurate
                  functionality of the collar. To help you find the perfect fit,
                  we offer custom sizing for all of our collars.

                    Custom sized martingale collars are typically made with your

                    to adjust both smaller and larger in size
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The smaller the collar, the less material it will have to
                    adjust (when compared to large collars) -- ordering a custom
                    sized collar gives you the most possible room for smaller
                    dogs

                  <li>
                    For puppies, custom sizing allows you to purchase a collar
                    slightly larger than currently needed, giving your pup room
                    to grow into the collar

                <h2>Choosing a Width for Martingales</h2>
                <p>
                  In general, we suggest ordering a martingale in a 1" or 1.5"
                  width. A wider collar will distribute the pressure across a
                  larger area of your dog’s neck, making it more comfortable and
                  more effective. For strong dogs, heavy pullers, or puppies
                  expected to grow rapidly, a wider collar would be ideal.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>3/4" may be appropriate for very small dogs</li>
                  <li>
                    1" is perfect for medium-sized and larger dogs -- this is
                    the most common size for Martingale Collars
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1.5" is best suited for large dogs or those with long,
                    delicate necks such as sighthounds
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  There are two different adjustments for martingale collars
                  that you should be aware of, detailed below. Please note that
                  none of our buckles are strength rated for continuous jerking
                  and as such should not be used with a tie-out -- martingale
                  collars especially should not be used without supervision, on
                  a tie-out, or with a retractable leash. Doing so may endanger
                  your dog's safety.
                </p>
                <h2>Walking and Training: On-Leash</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To ensure the proper fit, pull the collar up to the top of
                    your dog's neck, so that it sits just behind the ears. You
                    want to adjust the collar to be snug in this location, as
                    this is the smallest part of the neck (before going over the
                    head). This will prevent your dog from being able to slip
                    out of the collar.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once tension is relieved from the collar it should sit
                    comfortably mid-neck and be slightly looser fitting than a
                    flat collar. The measurements of a martingale collar are
                    that of the collar in use. When in use and pulled tight the
                    hardware on the control loop should never touch! There
                    should always be two fingers width (about 2") between the
                    hardware.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Supervised Use: Off-Leash</h2>
                <p>
                  For safety, many professionals recommend only using a
                  martingale collar under direct supervision, (during walking or
                  training) and removing the collar when not in use. Should you
                  choose to leave the collar on your dog while off leash, the
                  collar should always be loose enough to slide off of your
                  dog's head -- this will prevent accidental strangulation
                  should the control loop get caught on anything. The two slides
                  on the control loop should easily touch when adjusted in this
                  way. The collar should sit comfortably, roughly mid neck once
                  adjusted. It will be looser than a flat collar, and looser
                  still than a martingale used for walking. You should easily be
                  able to slide your entire hand under the collar.

                  <li>
                    The control loop on the collar should have enough slack to
                    pull into a symmetrical triangular shape when a leash is
                    attached and pulled
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the control loop is flush against the collar and does not
                    provide slack when pulled, the collar is too tight
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the hardware at the base of the loop is touching, the
                    collar is too loose
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  It is important that your dog does not lean into the collar
                  and consistently pull. Martingales are designed to tighten
                  when necessary and remain relaxed the majority of the time.
                  When your dog pulls, gently pull back. Stop walking if
                  necessary. As soon as your dog releases the pressure applied
                  to the collar, continue walking. Your dog will quickly learn
                  not to put pressure on the collar.

                  <strong>Not for Unsupervised Use - </strong>Martingales should
                  not be left on your dog when they are unsupervised, they can
                  be snagged and pulled off or pulled tight on your dog.

                  >Dogs that constantly pull against the leash should have a
                  harness to restrain them in addition to the martingale. Not
                  for Off leash Play - Because martingale collars sit looser on
                  a dog's neck than flat collars, they may be more easily
                  snagged when a dog is playing with other dogs or adventuring.
                  For this reason, it is best to switch to a flat collar with
                  your dog's ID after your walk to the dog park.

                <p>
                  <strong> Not for Retractable Leashes - </strong>The constant
                  tension from retractable leashes can tighten the martingale

                  dog to understand whether she is pulling too hard or not.
                  Additionally, these leashes come with their own safety
                  concerns and should be used wit caution.

          the effectiveness in teaching leash training. The collars add control
          and do not allow dogs to back out. The way the collars fit on a dog,
          when done correctly, distributes pressure around the entire neck and
          avoids simply putting pressure on the trachea like a typical dog
          collar. So, for health and safety reasons, these collars are the best.
